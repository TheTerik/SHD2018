 This is a Science Hack Day Berlin 2018 Project

## Description:
Some health conditions might require daily use of urine test strips.
The reading is however subjective and time-consuming.
We developed a script to automatically log daily test strip measurements from a photograph into a spreadsheet.
Additionaly, results can be shown in a graph to easily observe changes.
As a prove of concept we analysed single reading of pH, however additional measurements, such as glucose, blood in urine and others are possible to implement.
